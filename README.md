# `mutablesecurity.github.io` 🏗️

## Description 🖼️

**`mutablesecurity.github.io`** is the *landing page* of **MutableSecurity**.

# Newly Added:
# 1) Hotjar tracking in index.html
# (Optional: install: npm install -g mkcert ( local SSH certificate to test local server) )
# 2) install: npm i serve
# 3) to run local server: npm start ( or npm run-script prod )
# (The certificate crt is "cert.crt" and the certificate key is "cert.key". Also, check out the "ca.cert" and "cer.crt" files for the trust policy.)


# To Do: Push the changes to the main site in order to install the hotjar into the html file (In order to see the changes on the github site and to be able to install the Hotjar extension). On local host it keeps breaking. Also, complete the survey from the site.
